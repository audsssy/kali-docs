# Kali

Kali is an application to launch DAO smart contracts and form companies. It allows founders and communities to build on-chain governance and enforce their commitments with code. It is end-to-end, so users don't need to know anything about contracts, deployment, or run their own servers or nodes to manage proposals and voting. The contracts are inspired by the [Compound](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance) and [Moloch](https://molochdao.gitbook.io/handbook/introduction/wtf-is-moloch) frameworks, prioritizing lean, reasonably optimized code. The application further allows users to draft and wrap their contract deployments with legal agreements, such as LLC structures for investment clubs and companies.

## Features

V1 includes the following features:
- **tokenized votes** as ERC-20 assets, which can be transferable or non-transferable
- **delegateable votes** to representatives
- **customizable governance** settings, such as voting periods and approval thresholds
- **quorum, supermajority** threshold settings, which can be assigned to proposal types
- **gas-less metaTX support** for voting and token transfers
- **extension support**, including fundraising by token sale or 'tribute', whitelisting, and 'ragequit' 
- **treasury support**, including ETH, ERC-20, NFT and ERC-1155

## Legal Support

Kali was incubated by [LexDAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/) and [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) to solve the legal pain points of web3 founders and funds.

It includes a legal drafting tool for LLC, Investment Club and UNA governing docs, and Kali users can instantly deploy an LLC by minting an NFT under the [master operating agreement of KaliCo Ricardian LLC](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdHFNxtecmCNcTscWJqnA4AiASyk3SHCgKamugLHqR23i), a Delaware Series LLC. For more information on this formation system, review the sister LexDAO research project, [Ricardian LLC](https://ricardian.gitbook.io/ricardian-llc/).

For formation assistance for standalone LLCs and questions on DAO legal setup and compliance, Kali integrates with the [LexDAO community of lawyers and engineers](https://www.lexdao.coop/#/directory).

## Security

An audit on the core Kali contracts was conducted by BlockApex and can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/kalidao/kali-contracts/blob/main/audit/Final_Audit_KaliDAO.pdf). Unit tests in JS for the core contracts, including extensions, can be run [here](https://github.com/kalidao/kali-contracts/tree/main/test).
