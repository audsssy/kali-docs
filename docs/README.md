# Kali

Kali is an application to form companies and launch DAO smart contracts. The contracts are inspired by the [Compound](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance) and [Moloch](https://molochdao.gitbook.io/handbook/introduction/wtf-is-moloch) governance frameworks, prioritizing lean, reasonably optimized code. The application further allows users to draft and wrap their contract deployments with legal agreements, such as LLC structures for investment clubs and companies.

V1 includes the following features:
- **tokenized votes** as ERC-20 assets, which can be transferable or non-transferable
- **delegateable votes** to representatives
- **customizable governance** settings
- **quorum, supermajority** threshold settings, which can be assigned to proposal types
- **gas-less metaTX support** for voting and token transfers
- **extension support**, including fundraising by token sale or 'tribute', whitelisting, and 'ragequit' 
- **treasury support**, including ETH, ERC-20, NFT and ERC-1155
