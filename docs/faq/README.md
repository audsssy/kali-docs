# FAQ

## What is KALI?

KALI is an application to streamline DAO and legal structure deployments. It includes an end-to-end tokenization, voting and proposal system, as well as LLC formation and legal agreement drafting software.

## What is a DAO?

A DAO is like a shared bank account, but operated in an open, transparent manner and enforced by code or “smart contracts”.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is code on a blockchain that will run exactly as programmed. They can operate assets and for DAOs, enforce the outcomes of voting, such as membership inclusion, exclusion and payments. Smart contracts deployed on KALI will survive the platform, don’t depend on KALI developers, and will persist and run as expected as long as blockchains continue to run. Smart contracts therefore give KALI users true ownership of their organizations.

## Why do DAOs need Legal Structure?

DAOs are managed by people, and as they typically involve the pooling and use of assets, can create traditional legal liabilities for all involved parties. Without a formal legal structure, jurisdictions will typically treat DAOs as unincorporated general partnerships, giving members joint and several liability for claims made against the DAO. This effectively means that a single member could be held responsible for the entire sum of damages in the event of unfavourable litigation. Limiting the liability of DAOs through light-weight legal structures has been therefore seen as a common sense solution for DAOs to scale and operate with “IRL” concerns, such as hiring and making investments.
